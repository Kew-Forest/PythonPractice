"""
 You are an Elfin warrior:
Life: 80	Strength: 76	Speed: 85	Gold: 0

You are in a dungeon and come to a fork. You can go right or left.

If you go left you come to a room with a pot of 200 gold and a magic bracelet which increases your Strength by 10. Then you must go back to the fork and choose again.
   
If you go right, you are attacked by a Gorgon: 
Life: 50	Strength: 85	Speed: 10	Gold: 500	

You can choose to fight or flee:
 Flee: 
If your speed is greater than the Gorgonâ€™s, you retreat back to the fork
If not, you lose 50 life and choose again

Fight:
If your Strength is greater, and your Life is greater: you win collect the gold and move on
Your strength is less and your life is more or strength is more, life is less: you lose 20 life points and choose again
Your strength is less and your life is less: you lose 50 life points and choose again
